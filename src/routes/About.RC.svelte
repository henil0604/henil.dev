				In 2020, I jumped into web development—and I've been loving it
				ever since. I started with the usual suspects: JavaScript, PHP,
				and Node.js, building random projects just to see what I could
				make. Along the way, I discovered TypeScript, because, let's be
				honest, writing safer code just makes life easier. Then came
				frameworks like React, Vue, and meta-frameworks like Next.js and
				Nuxt.js—which felt like leveling up in a video game.

				As I dug deeper, I became obsessed with web security and learned
				about server-client communication and authentication. That's
				when I realized I actually love backend way more than frontend.
				So, I dove into tools like Express.js, Hono, and Elysia, and
				that's pretty much where I've been since.

				Now, Svelte has stolen my developer heart. It's so simple and
				efficient—it's like the universe gave me a framework that just
				makes sense. These days, I use Svelte for everything, and I'm
				not looking back.
